![WEIT PNG](https://github.com/kayeneii/WEIT_2015-2024/blob/main/WEIT.png)

## Overview
This project was built to analyze and predict energy investment trends worldwide with the aid of the World Energy Investment 2024 Datafile by the IEA. The major goal was to identify key metrics and trends that help understand energy investment patterns globally, track energy typology, and identify key regions driving energy investment. Additionally, the findings of the data was used to predict future trends to ascertain probability of meeting SDG 2030 Goal.

## Dataset
A data frame with 112 observations on 10 (numeric) variables was created from the World Energy Investment 2024 Datafile.xlsx provided by the _International Energy Agency_ (IEA). You can find it at [IEA](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/world-energy-investment-2024-datafile).

## Objectives
To derive answers to the following questions:
  - What is the annual energy investment in:
       * Africa
       * Asia Pacific
       * Central and South America
       * Eurasia
       * Europe
       * Middle East
       * North America
  and what percentage was spent on energy generation and storage?
  - Which region recorded the highest investment in energy since 2020?
  - What was the percentage difference in energy investment across all seven regions between 2019 and 2020? Was it an increase or decrease?
  - What 3 regions had the highest investment in Clean Energy as at 2024? (Clean Energy includes: Clean Fuels, Transitional fossil fuels, Nuclear, Renewables, Storage, Electricity networks, Fossil  fuels: with CCUS and End-use.) 
  - What is the future investment trend for the next five years in:
       * Africa
       * Asia Pacific
       * Central and South America
       * Eurasia
       * Europe
       * Middle East
       * North America
  - What is the probability of each region meeting the SDG 7 [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda)?

    
## Methods
The following tools were used in the creation of this report.
1. **Microsoft Excel:** For data exploration, cleaning and preparation.
  * Data Cleaning and Preparation:
    - Data loading and inspection
    - Data cleaning

  * Foresight & Data Prediction: The FORECAST function was used to predict the energy investment of each region from 2025-2030.
       
2. **Microsoft Power BI:** For,
  * Further Data Processing:
    - Data loading and quality inspection
    - Data transformation and formatting

  * Data Analysis: During the analysis, the following measures were created in the Power Query to calculate the percentage of the region with the highest investment in clean energy. {i.e., Total energy investment / Asia-Pacific clean energy investment * 100}

     ```DAX Percentage = 859136000000 / 1661000000000 * 100 ```

  * Data Visualizations: Cards, Column and Line Charts were used to visually plot out the annual investment rates,  clean energy investment, energy investment profile of each region, and other summarized data.

  * Report Creation

3. **GitHUb:** For portfolio building

4. **LinkedIn:** For communication.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7.3 Agenda states that all countries and stakeholders are required to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. In 2024, the global investment in energy efficiency stood at $354.54 Billion (USD) worldwide. Therefore by 2030, this figure should have increased to at least $709 Billion (USD). The probability of this happening
