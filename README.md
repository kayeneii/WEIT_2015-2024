## Overview
This project was built to analyze and predict energy investment trends worldwide with the aid of the World Energy Investment 2024 Datafile by the IEA. The major goal was to identify key metrics and trends that help understand energy investment patterns globally, track energy typology, and identify key regions driving energy investment. Additionally, the findings of the data was used to predict future trends to ascertain probability of meeting SDG 2030 Goal.

## Dataset
A data frame with 112 observations on 10 (numeric) variables was created from the World Energy Investment 2024 Datafile.xlsx provided by the _International Energy Agency_ (IEA). You can find it at [IEA](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/world-energy-investment-2024-datafile).

## Objectives
To derive answers to the following questions:
  - What is the year-on-year energy investment in:
       * Africa
       * Asia Pacific
       * Central and South America
       * Eurasia
       * Europe
       * Middle East
       * North America
  and what percentage was spent on energy generation and storage?
  - Which region recorded the highest investment in energy over the last 5 years?
  - What 3 regions had the highest investment in Clean Energy as at 2024? (Clean Energy includes: Clean Fuels, Transitional fossil fuels, Nuclear, Renewables, Storage, Electricity networks, Fossil  fuels: with CCUS and End-use.) 
  - What is the future investment trend for the next five years in:
       * Africa
       * Asia Pacific
       * Central and South America
       * Eurasia
       * Europe
       * Middle East
       * North America
  - What is the probability of each region meeting the SDG 7 [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda)?
